Your course grade will be determined by the following weighting:
• Survey paper 30% (half each for draft and final paper). 
• Short presentation 10%.
• Long presentation 10%.
• Poster 10%.
• Peer support (rehearsal attendance, peer feedback days) 5%. • Additional skills: 5% each (up to 35% for seven).

In addition, in order to pass the course, you must complete all of the core course components:
• Survey paper
• Short presentation 
• Long presentation • Poster presentation

Each student will prepare and deliver a short slideshow-based talk during the Fall term. The purpose of this talk is to learn how to prepare useful slides, how to pace yourself when giving a time-limited talk, and how to field questions from an audience. In your short talk, you will introduce the basic definitions needed for your topic as well as a broad overview of the topic’s history and context within the general field of study.

Rehearsals are important; to make it possible for everyone to practice their talks, I expect each of you to support your peers in rehearsing their talks too. You will each give me some sort of evidence of having been a supportive peer and given two other students feedback on their rehearsal, most likely during one of our in-class rehearsal opportunities, or you could schedule rehearsals at a time more convenient for you and your peers.
