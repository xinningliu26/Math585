Your course grade will be determined by the following weighting:
• Survey paper 30% (half each for draft and final paper). 
• Short presentation 10%.
• Long presentation 10%.
• Poster 10%.
• Peer support (rehearsal attendance, peer feedback days) 5%. • Additional skills: 5% each (up to 35% for seven).

In addition, in order to pass the course, you must complete all of the core course components:
• Survey paper
• Short presentation 
• Long presentation 
• Poster presentation

Additional Learning Objectives:
• Making the student/supervisor relationship productive.
• Leveraging professional organizations and grants.
• Taking charge of your well-being: mental health and time management. 
• Developing a CV and Teaching Dossier.
• Finding, and making the most of, conferences.
• Postsecondary teaching:
– classroom management basics,
– active learning,
– formative and summative assessment design,
– accessible and equitable classrooms,
– other topics available by request (to be discussed in class)
• Learn two technical skills (multiple pairs permitted):
– Rstudio
– Jupiter Notebooks
– GitHub
– Professional academic website design
– Intermediate LATEX: building figures
– Intermediate LATEX: bibtex and related tools
– other topics available by proposal (to be discussed in class)

My expectation is that you will deliver this talk in its natural setting, such as during a seminar! I do not need to be present for this talk, but if I am not then your supervisor must be and they will submit your feedback to me to use in your final course assessment. If you cannot find a suitable venue for your talk, we can fit some of them in to our scheduled class time, most likely during a workshop week in the Spring term. If your advisor will be unable to provide an evaluation, please talk to me and I will arrange for an alternative (for example by attending your seminar talk myself, or finding another faculty member who can).

Your long presentation will probably be on the same topic as your survey paper, or on one specific aspect of it. Please consult with me first if you need to present on a different topic.

Once again, I expect each of you to support your peers in rehearsing their talks too. You will each give me some sort of evidence of having been a supportive peer and given two other students your feedback on their rehearsal.
